We are the upstream for Malayalam fonts and tools for popular GNU/Linux-based operating systems such as Fedora and Debian. We also maintain localizations for popular Free Software Desktops (GNOME/KDE), popular applications such as Firefox and Libre Office.",
  "smc-about-text-para-2": "SMC also works on developing accessibility support for Indic languages and maintains Dhvani TTS which supports 11 languages. Over the years, SMC has evolved to accommodate developers focused on Indic script-based languages and now provides tools for Indic language computation as well.",

We are not just developers, we also have linguists, journalists, Wikipedians, writers and all sorts of language users among us.",
